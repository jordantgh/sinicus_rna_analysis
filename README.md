# Rhinolophus sinicus RNA sequencing analysis pipelines

- reference_pipeline.sh gets the rna seq and wgs data, and does genome indexing and alignment
- denovo.sh is work in process to get the rna seq data aligned against a reference de novo transcriptome rather than a reference genome
- The R_files directory has a (very) basic plotting function, can be improved
